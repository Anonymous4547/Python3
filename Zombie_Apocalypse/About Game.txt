This is a game about a zombie apocalypse made by Ahnaf in Python 3.8 on Arch Linux
First I imported random and time. Random is for making random choices and generating
random strings and numbers
In the beginning it asks your name.
Then it tells you students got sick from eating the food at school and became zombies!
In level one you have to kill a random number of zombies with a couple of weapons!
Then in level 2 you have to guess a number between 1 and 2000
In Level 3 there is not much
In the end it just gives you a final score!
I might add more detail later down the line.
